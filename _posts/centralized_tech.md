## Introduction
We completely undervalue the relationship between our devices and the world over consideration for the relationship between us and our devices. I would suggest that more of the value we get from technology comes though our data channels, whether that be your ISP or your cell provider, rather than from the technology itself. At its essence, the phone is an interface, a physical abstraction with which to interact with digital media, but if the digital media we interact with is only partially under our control, then our existence in this realm will be limited similarly.

## Information Value
The hardware and even the operating system of our devices leave a wide range of experiences, that can have a wide range of impact on us, to be defined and experienced. By looking to content creators, publishers, aggregators, etc. we are using perceived adaquet specification of preference in exchange for content. The ambiguity of this specification can be exploited for profit by those seeking to control other externalities of potentional interpretations of this specification.

## Information Sources
Entities that control in small ways the contents of a stream of information consumed by a large number of people can hit thresholds that allow the influence of that control to make large impact, 

## Information Expression
Our limited interpretations of the world and ourselves limit our ability to become more complex beings in response to the real complexities of the world. Oversimpliification to attain maximum net impact creates incentives for approaching norms and rejecting diversity in uncommon dimensions.
